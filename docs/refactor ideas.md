- [ ] Convert dimensions to classes or introduce new properties to their types to consolidate their behavior and characteristics, instead of having a lot of separated functions w/o real connection
	- Context: when adding [[TemporalEntityDimension]], I needed to go through a lot of functions like `canDimensionBeMultiFiltered`, `isTemporalDimension`, `SEGMENT_COMPONENT_TYPES` etc. Having a dedicated class that would entail the same properties across dimensions would make it impossible to forget about such specifications.
