## Data protection

Based on Article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution and the provisions of Swiss data protection legislation, everyone has the right to the protection of privacy, as well as to protection from misuse of their personal details. The authorities involved in the visualize.admin.ch portal comply with these provisions. Personal data is treated as strictly confidential on the visualize.admin.ch portal and is neither passed on nor sold to third parties.

In close cooperation with our hosting providers, we make every effort to protect the databases from outside access, data loss, misuse or falsification.

When you access visualize.admin.ch, the following data is stored in log files: IP address, date, time, browser request and general information on the operating system and browser. Our hosting providers’ web servers merely register impersonal site usage data (log files) for the purpose of tracking trends for the authorities involved in the visualize.admin.ch portal in order to improve the information offering. For further information on web analysis, see the next section.

Usage data are not linked to personal data. There is an exception, namely when you choose to make contact with us. If you register your e-mail address, this is then stored in a separate database not connected in any way with the anonymous log files. You may delete your registration at any time.

## Web analysis

The portal visualize.admin.ch uses Google Analytics, an internet site analysis service provided by Google Inc. ("Google").

Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files placed on your computer to help the internet site to analyse the use made of the site by its users. The data generated by the cookies on your use of the site (including your IP address) are sent to Google and stored by them on servers located in the United States. Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the site, to compile reports on site activity for the website owner and to provide other services in relation with activity on the site and internet use. Google may release this information to third parties, including the owner of this website, if there is a legal obligation to do so or if such third parties process data on behalf of Google. Google will not link your IP address with any other data held by Google.

On the portal visualize.admin.ch the IP anonymisation has been activated. This means that the IP addresses transferred by Google Analytics to its server in order to monitor the use made by visitors to the site are automatically and immediately shortened by deleting the last three numbers of the IP address.

You can disable the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, if you do so this may prevent you from using some of the functions on our site. Furthermore, you can prevent Google from compiling and using the data generated by cookies in relation to your use of the site (including your IP address) by downloading and installing the [browser plugin](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en).

By using this internet site, you expressly agree to the processing of your non-personal data by Google according to the terms and purposes described above.
