> The Homepage is the main page you see when you enter the Visualize app.

It consists of 4 different components: Intro, Tutorial, Examples and Contribute.
In order to compose a complete Homepage, you have to use them all in the correct
order.

You can either import them directly to JSX files or create a separate MDX file
and use a MDXProvider to render the page (see ContentMDXProvider component).

<Canvas of={HomepageStories.Homepage} />
