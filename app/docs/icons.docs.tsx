> Iconography is used throughout user interface of the application. The _Visualization Tool_ uses its own icon set, inspired by the official icon font described on the [«Confederation Web Guidelines»](https://swiss.github.io/styleguide/en/general.html#02-general-08-icons) — featuring consistent proportion and meaning.
