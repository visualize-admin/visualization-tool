> Chart Selection Tabs are used in ChartPreview and ChartPublished to enable selecting a chart type in any stage of creating a chart.

They can be either _editable_, to display a button to show ChartTypeSelector (used when creating a chart) or not, to disable that functionality (used in published charts).

<Meta of={ChartSelectionTabsStories} />


## Editable

<Canvas of={ChartSelectionTabsStories.Editable} />


## Non-editable

<Canvas of={ChartSelectionTabsStories.NonEditable} />

## For developers

This component is based on MUI's Tabs & Tab components, styled in the federal theme.

Currently it does not support multiple tabs, as this will be implemented together with chart composition.
