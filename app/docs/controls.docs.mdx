## OnOffControlTab

OnOffControlTab (and OnOffControlTabField) are elements which are supposed to be
used on the left panel in the app as category "switches" (like for BaseLayer in
case of maps or InteractiveFilters for... interactive filters). They display
either "on" or "off" to indicate component state.
