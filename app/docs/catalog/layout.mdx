### Spacings

_Visualize_ uses a limited set of space-variables, to construct the user interface structure. This allows for the great flexibility, while allowing to define relationships between elements on a global level. The system of global space-variables is documented below:

<TableSpecimen
  rows={[
    { Variable: "space-0", Measurements: "0 rem" },
    { Variable: "space-1", Measurements: "0.25 rem" },
    { Variable: "space-2", Measurements: "0.5 rem" },
    { Variable: "space-3", Measurements: "0.75 rem" },
    { Variable: "space-4", Measurements: "1 rem (16px)" },
    { Variable: "space-5", Measurements: "1.5 rem" },
    { Variable: "space-6", Measurements: "2 rem" },
    { Variable: "space-7", Measurements: "4 rem" },
  ]}
