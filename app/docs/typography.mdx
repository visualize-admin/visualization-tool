> [Frutiger](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frutiger_(typeface)>) is used as the primary font across all of the _Visualization Tool_. A typographic scale is used to create a limited set of type sizes that work well together, while respecting intrinsic platform standards. Helvetica, Arial or a generic sans-serif font is used as a fall-back.
